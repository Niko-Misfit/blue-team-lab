# Blue Team Lab

This project is a modular Blue Team lab built with Docker and ELK Stack. It captures logs from simulated attacks and visualizes them using Kibana dashboards. Perfect for learning log analysis, detection engineering, and SOC fundamentals.

## Contents
- Docker setup for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana
- Scenarios for detecting port scans, brute-force attempts, and reverse shells
- Scripts for testing log ingestion and parsing

Built and tested using nested virtualization (Hyper-V > Proxmox > Ubuntu).
